Changes I Made

- reference updated menu excel doc for changed urls based on naming consistency
- acoustic-outdoor-barrier-walls page shortened bullet points for readability

Notes

- I added a script to always update the copyright date in the footer to the current year.
- I optimized all images and the video to make sure the site loads as fast as possible.

Recommendations

- as of now the form responses go nowhere. That will need to be configured
- I think the original site used a google form, if they want the same fuctionality I'd have to get access to their google account to get the code and the script for it to work properly. There is probably some API key that has to be used in order to validate that the site can use their google account for form responses.
