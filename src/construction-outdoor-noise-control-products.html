          OSHA, ANSI, and many state regulatory bodies have put forth
          regulations to ensure that construction companies control noise
          pollution at construction sites. Measures must be taken to conserve
          the hearing of construction workers and any others affected by noise
          generated from a construction site.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-normal">
          IES 2000 offers a wide range of standard products to help outdoor
          construction operations combat noise pollution. We also possess the
          capability to design and engineer custom solutions for your
          noise-control issues.
